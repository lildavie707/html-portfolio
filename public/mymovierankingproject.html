<h1>The Best Movies According to David</h1>

<h2>My All-Time Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr/>

<h2>Tommy Boy</h2>
<p>This is my absolute favorite movie of all time.  It is a very funny movie with a lot of memorable lines.</p>
<h2>Pretty Woman</h2>
<p>Even though this is a chic flic and a romantic comedy.  It is one of the best movies ever made.  It is funny and it shows that even someone who is from a life that is usually seen as disgusting and immoral can be a good person and if given the opportunity can make a positive impact.</p>
<h2>With Honors</h2>
<p>This movie shows that there are more important things in life than getting honors for work or school achievements.  An unexpected friendship changes the course of a student at Harvard and he gives up his opportunity to graduate with honors from Harvard University.  You will CRY so bring your tissues.</p>
